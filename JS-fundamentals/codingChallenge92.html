      //         Scenario
      // Several people are standing in a row divided into two teams.
      // The first person goes into team 1, the second goes into team 2, the third goes into team 1, and so on.

      // Task
      // Given an array of positive integers (the weights of the people), return a new array/tuple of two integers, where the first one is the total weight of team 1, and the second one is the total weight of team 2.

      // Notes
      // Array size is at least 1.
      // All numbers will be positive.
      // Input >> Output Examples
      // rowWeights([13, 27, 49])  ==>  return (62, 27)
      // Explanation:
      // The first element 62 is the total weight of team 1, and the second element 27 is the total weight of team 2.

      // rowWeights([50, 60, 70, 80])  ==>  return (120, 140)
      // Explanation:
      // The first element 120 is the total weight of team 1, and the second element 140 is the total weight of team 2.

      function rowWeights(array) {
        //your code here
        array = array.flat();
        let storeSumTeam1 = 0;
        let storeSumTeam2 = 0;

        for (let [i, weight] of array.entries()) {
          if (i % 2 === 0) {
            storeSumTeam1 += weight;
          } else {
            storeSumTeam2 += weight;
          }
        }
        return [storeSumTeam1, storeSumTeam2];
      }
      let output = rowWeights([13]);
      console.log(output);
