      //         An Arithmetic Progression is defined as one in which there is a
      //         constant difference between the consecutive terms of a given series of
      //         numbers. You are provided with consecutive elements of an Arithmetic
      //         Progression. There is however one hitch: exactly one term from the
      //         original series is missing from the set of numbers which have been
      //         given to you. The rest of the given series is the same as the original AP. Find the missing term.

      // least 3 numbers. The missing term will never be the first or last one.
