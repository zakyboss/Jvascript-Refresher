      //           Enough is enough!
      //   Alice and Bob were on a holiday. Both of them took many pictures of the places they've been,
      //   and now they want to show Charlie their entire collection. However, Charlie doesn't like
      //    these sessions, since the motif usually repeats. He isn't fond of seeing the Eiffel tower 40 times.
      //   He tells them that he will only sit for the session if they show the same motif at most
      //   N times. Luckily, Alice and Bob are able to encode the motif as a number. Can you help
      //    them to remove numbers such that their list contains each number only up to N times, without changing the order?

      //   Task
      //   Given a list and a number, create a new list that contains each number of list at most N times, without reordering.
      //   For example if the input number is 2, and the input list is [1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3], you take [1,2,3,1,2],
      //    drop the next [1,2] since this would lead to 1 and 2 being in the result 3 times, and then take 3,
      //    which leads to [1,2,3,1,2,3].
      //   //   With list [20,37,20,21] and number 1, the result would be [20,37,21].
        // function deleteNth(arr, n) {
        //   // ...
        //   let storeOutput = [];
        //   let elementCount = {};
        //   for (const num of arr) {
        //     if (elementCount[num]) {
        //       elementCount[num]++;
        //     } else {
        //       elementCount[num] = 1;
        //     }
        //     if (elementCount[num] <= n) {
        //       storeOutput.push(num);
        //     }
        //   }
        //   return storeOutput;
        // }
        // let output = deleteNth([1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3], 3);
        // console.log(output);

      //   Given a string, return an array of characters that appear more
      //   than once in the string, in the order they first appear.
