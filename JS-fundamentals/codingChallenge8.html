//         Let's improve Steven's tip calculator even more, this time using loops!

// Your tasks:

// Create an array called bills containing all 10 test bill values.

// Create empty arrays for the tips and the totals (tips and totals)

// Use the calcTip function we wrote before (included in the starter code) to calculate tips and total values (bill + tip) for every bill value in the bills array.
//  Use a for loop to perform the 10 calculations!


let bills = [22, 295, 176, 440, 37, 105, 10, 1100, 86, 52];
let tips = [];
let totals = [];
  const calcTip = function (){
    let tip ; 
    for (let i = 0 ; i<bills.length; i++){
        if (bills[i]>=50 && bills[i]<=300){
            tip=(bills[i]*15/100)

        }else {
            tip=(bills[i]*20/100)
        }
        tips.push(tip)

        totals.push(bills[i]+tip)

    }
  }
  calcTip();
  console.log(tips , totals)





// TEST DATA: 22, 295, 176, 440, 37, 105, 10, 1100, 86, and 52.



// BONUS:

// Write a function calcAverage which takes an array called arr as an argument. This function calculates the average of all numbers in the given array. This is a DIFFICULT challenge (we haven't done this before)! Here is how to solve it if you feel like it:

// First, you will need to add up all values in the array. To do the addition, start by creating a variable sum that starts at 0. Then loop over the array using a for loop. In each iteration, add the current value to the sum variable. This way, by the end of the loop, you have all values added together.

// To calculate the average, divide the sum you calculated before by the length of the array (because that's the number of elements).

// Call the function with the totals array.

let arr = [12,24,54,76,8,10,89]
 let calcAverage = function (){
    let sum =0 ;
let average=0  ;
   for (let i=0 ; i<arr.length ; i++){

      sum = sum + arr[i]
    average = (sum/arr.length)

   }
   return sum

 }
 let result = calcAverage();
 console.log(result)
