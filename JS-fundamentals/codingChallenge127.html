      //     Jaden Smith, the son of Will Smith, is the star of films such as The Karate Kid
      //     (2010) and After Earth (2013). Jaden is also known for some of his philosophy
      //     that he delivers via Twitter. When writing on Twitter, he is known for almost
      //      always capitalizing every word. For simplicity, you'll have to capitalize each
      //      word, check out how contractions are expected to be in the example below.

      // Your task is to convert strings to how they would be written by Jaden Smith. The
      // strings are actual quotes from Jaden Smith, but they are not capitalized in the same way he originally typed them.

      // Example:

      // Not Jaden-Cased: "How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't real"
      // Jaden-Cased:     "How Can Mirrors Be Real If Our Eyes Aren't Real"
      String.prototype.toJadenCase = function () {
  // Split the string into an array of words
  let words = this.split(" ");

  // Capitalize the first letter of each word
  let capitalizedWords = words.map(word => {
    let firstLetter = word.charAt(0).toUpperCase(); // First letter capitalized
    let restOfWord = word.slice(1); // Rest of the word unchanged
    return firstLetter + restOfWord;
  });

  // Join the words back into a single string
  return capitalizedWords.join(" ");
};

// Example usage
let sentence = "How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't real";
console.log(sentence.toJadenCase());
